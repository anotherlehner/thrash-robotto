# Thrash Robotto

My first 7DRL challenge and one that I ran out of time with. I think I learned this was far too ambitious for such a short challenge. I was hoping to make a mech arena combat game, something tactical with turn based actions. I got as far as a little mech shooting missiles and blowing up autogenerated terrain. Good lessons and a fun experience.
